abstract="A large number of MPI implementations are currently available, each of which emphasize different aspects of high-performance computing or are intended to solve a specific research problem. The result is a myriad of incompatible MPI implementations, all of which require separate installation, and the combination of which present significant logistical challenges for end users. Building upon prior research, and influenced by experience gained from the code bases of the LAM/MPI, LA-MPI, and FT-MPI projects, Open MPI is an all-new, production-quality MPI-2 implementation that is fundamentally centered around component concepts. Open MPI provides a unique combination of novel features previously unavailable in an open-source, production-quality implementation of MPI. Its component architecture provides both a stable platform for third-party research as well as enabling the run-time composition of independent software add-ons. This paper presents a high-level overview the goals, design, and implementation of Open MPI.",

  abstract =     {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are becoming an important tool in
                  modern computing applications. Accelerating their training is
                  a major challenge and techniques range from distributed
                  algorithms to low-level circuit design. In this survey, we
                  describe the problem from a theoretical perspective, followed
                  by approaches for its parallelization. Specifically, we
                  present trends in DNN architectures and the resulting
                  implications on parallelization strategies. We discuss the
                  different types of concurrency in DNNs; synchronous and
                  asynchronous stochastic gradient descent; distributed system
                  architectures; communication schemes; and performance
                  modeling. Based on these approaches, we extrapolate potential
                  directions for parallelism in deep learning.},
